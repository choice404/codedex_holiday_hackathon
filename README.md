##   About

The Great Christmas Rescue is a text adventure game where you, the player has to go out and save Christmas from the naughty polar bear Herbert! You will go around the North Pole completing various tasks and helping out everyone there! However, depending on what you do, you could either end up on the Naughty or Nice list!

This project was made using a very alpha version of a library made by Austin that uses curses under the hood to create the user interface in the terminal 

The project is still incomplete and is being worked on by the team currently. We hope to get this finished soon for everyone to enjoy!
